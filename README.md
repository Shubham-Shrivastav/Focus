# Focus AdBlocker Browser Extension

## Description

The Focus AdBlocker Extension is designed to enhance your web browsing experience by blocking unwanted advertisements, including display ads, video ads, tracking scripts, and sponsored content, on various websites. This extension helps improve page load times, reduces distractions, and enhances online privacy.

## Features

- **Display Ad Blocking**: Blocks common display ads served by ad networks and domains.
- **Video Ad Blocking**: Prevents the playback of video ads from platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.
- **Tracking Script Blocking**: Blocks tracking scripts that collect user data.
- **Sponsored Content Removal**: Hides or removes sponsored content elements from web pages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive popup interface for enabling/disabling the ad blocker.

## How It Works

The extension uses a content script to intercept and block network requests to known ad domains and tracking servers. It also includes options to enable or disable ad blocking based on user preferences.

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store (provide a link if available).
2. Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to access the popup.
3. Use the toggle switch to enable or disable the ad blocker.

## Known Limitations

- While the extension blocks many common ads, it may not block all types of ads, especially those employing sophisticated techniques.
- Some websites may detect ad blockers and request users to disable them for access.

## Future Improvements

- Continuously update the list of blocked domains to keep up with changes in the advertising landscape.
- Explore advanced ad-blocking techniques for more effective blocking.
- Gather user feedback and consider implementing additional features based on user requests.
